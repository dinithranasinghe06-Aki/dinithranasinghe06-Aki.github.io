            <h2>Practice Tips</h2>
            <p><strong>Regular practice</strong> is important when learning guitar. Short daily sessions are more effective than long, infrequent sessions. Consistency is the key to mastery!</p>
           
            <blockquote>If you want to be the best, then practice is a <strong>"MUST"</strong></blockquote>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Practice Daily</h3>
                    <p>Even 15-20 minutes every day is better than 2 hours once a week. Your muscle memory develops through consistent repetition.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Set Specific Goals</h3>
                    <p>Don't just "practice" - work on specific things: "Today I'll master the G to C chord change" or "I'll play this song at 80 BPM."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Start Slow</h3>
                    <p>Play at a tempo where you can be 100% accurate. Speed comes naturally once your fingers know where to go. Slow practice = Fast results!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Use a Metronome</h3>
                    <p>Timing is everything! A metronome keeps you honest and helps develop steady rhythm. Start at 60 BPM and gradually increase.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Build Finger Strength</h3>
                    <p>Your fingertips will hurt at first - this is normal! Take breaks when needed. Calluses will develop in 2-3 weeks of regular practice.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Record Yourself</h3>
                    <p>Use your phone to record practice sessions. You'll hear mistakes you don't notice while playing and track your improvement over time.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Practice Standing Up</h3>
                    <p>If you plan to perform, practice standing with a strap. Playing while standing feels different than sitting down!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Stay Relaxed</h3>
                    <p>Tension is your enemy! Keep your shoulders, arms, and hands relaxed. If you feel tense, stop and shake out your hands.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Play Songs You Love</h3>
                    <p>Technical exercises are important, but always spend time playing songs you enjoy. This keeps you motivated and makes practice fun!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Play with Others</h3>
                    <p>Find other beginners or join a jam session. Playing with others improves your timing and makes you a better, more confident musician.</p>
