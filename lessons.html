            <p>Welcome to your first guitar lesson! Understanding the guitar and how to hold it properly is crucial for your musical journey. A guitar consists of several key parts.</p>

                        <ul class="info-list">
                            <li><strong>Headstock:</strong> The top part where tuning pegs are located</li>
                            <li><strong>Neck:</strong> The long, thin part you press strings against</li>
                            <li><strong>Fretboard:</strong> The front surface of the neck with metal frets</li>
                            <li><strong>Body:</strong> The large hollow or solid part that produces sound</li>
                            <li><strong>Sound Hole:</strong> The circular opening that projects sound (acoustic guitars)</li>
                            <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Where strings are anchored on the body</li>
                            <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Usually 6 strings (from thickest to thinnest: E-A-D-G-B-E)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Holding Position:</h4>
                        <p>Maintaining correct posture while playing guitar is crucial for both comfort and technique development. When sitting, keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Rest the guitar's waist on your right leg (for right-handed players) with the neck angled slightly upward at approximately 45 degrees.</p>
                        
                        <p>Your fretting hand should be able to move freely along the neck without strain, while your strumming arm drapes naturally over the body of the guitar. Avoid slouching or hunching over the instrument, as this can lead to back and neck pain over time. Good posture also improves your ability to see the fretboard clearly and execute chord changes smoothly.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Strumming Patterns</h2>
            
            <p>Now that you know some chords, it's time to make them come alive with strumming! Strumming is the rhythmic movement of your hand across the strings. The pattern you use creates the "feel" of the song.</p>
            
            <blockquote>The most commonly used strumming pattern is the 4/4 pattern, which has 4 beats per measure.</blockquote>

                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li>Keep your wrist loose and relaxed - movement comes from the wrist, not the arm</li>
                    <li>Start SLOW! Use a metronome or tap your foot to keep steady time</li>
                    <li>Practice the motion even when not hitting strings - "air strumming" builds muscle memory</li>
                    <li>Down strums are usually on the beat (1, 2, 3, 4) - up strums are between beats</li>
                    <li>Don't worry about perfection - rhythm comes with consistent practice!</li>

When your legs don't work like they used to before
        G                         G
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
        D                      D
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

        D                    D
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
        G                              G
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
        D                         D
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
        G
Maybe just the touch of a hand
        Em                  A
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart
